## Car Accident Report
An application that shares the location of a vehicle in case of an accident. 

### System Design and Architecture
##### Shock detection circuit
For the circuit in charge of collecting the GPS data and detecting the shock, I used the following I used the following equipment:
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* MakerFocus GPS Module 51 Microcontroller Ublox GPS Compatible NEO-6M STM32 Arduino Navigation Satellite Positioning GT-U7
* WINGONEER 5PCS Collision detection module crash sensor collision switch keypad tuch-button touch switch robot 
* LED SLR-56VR3F
* Mophie 5V External Battery
* 2PCS 400 Point Solderless Breadboards
